# Hotel_Booking_EDA_Project
# **Project Summary -**

* This hotel booking analysis project aimed to enhance booking efficiency , predict guest preferences, and tailor hotel offerings to better meet market demands. The purpose of this exploratory data analysis (EDA) is to analyze customer data, uncover patterns in booking behavior, and identify key trends and  correlations
* This project is divided into five parts:
  1. Knowing Data
  2. Understanding dataset  Variables
  3. Data Wrangling
  4. Data Visualization, Storytelling & Experimenting with charts : Understanding  the relationships between variables and finding  insight
  5. Solution to Business Objective and  Conclusion
* In first step knowing data i find below information about dataset:

  *  In this project  dataset  have 119390 rows and 32 columns and this dataset include customer booking information.
  * All the columns are categorized into three data types: object, float64, and int64.
  * The column  present in dataset are  'hotel', 'is_canceled', 'lead_time', 'arrival_date_year','arrival_date_month', 'arrival_date_week_number','arrival_date_day_of_month', 'stays_in_weekend_nights','stays_in_week_nights', 'adults', 'children', 'babies', 'meal','country', 'market_segment', 'distribution_channel','is_repeated_guest', 'previous_cancellations','previous_bookings_not_canceled', 'reserved_room_type','assigned_room_type', 'booking_changes', 'deposit_type', 'agent','company', 'days_in_waiting_list', 'customer_type', 'adr','required_car_parking_spaces', 'total_of_special_requests''reservation_status', 'reservation_status_date
  * The dataset contains **31,994** duplicate rows and missing values in the **Company (112,593), Agent (16,340), Country (488), and Children (4)** columns.
* The second step was understanding the variables. I used the describe() method to analyze the central tendency and dispersion of the data. Additionally, I identified the unique values for each variables.
* Third step data wrangling involves data cleaning,handling outlier and variable classification,and last data transformation
 * In the Data Cleaning part, I dropped the **Company** column because  it had more than 50% null values and also  replaced null values with appropriate data types in the **Children, Agent, and Country** columns.Furthermore, I removed duplicate and inappropriate rows to ensure data quality and accuracy.
 * Variable classification and outlier handling step, I categorized the variables into categorical, numerical, discrete numerical, and continuous variables. The dataset contained 12 categorical variables, 19 numerical variables, 17 discrete numerical variables, and 2 continuous variables. Additionally, in the continuous variables, the columns **ADR** and **Lead Time** contained potential outliers, which I handled using the IQR (Interquartile Range) method.
 * In the data transformation phase, I converted dataset variables into appropriate data types. Further, I added some columns to the dataset to make it easier to use in data visualization and finding insights. The columns I added are **lead_time_classification, total_stay, total_people, total_children, is_room_assigned_as_mentioned,** and **guest_type.**
* The most important step in EDA is **Data Visualization**, experimenting with charts, understanding the relationships between variables, and finding insights. In this step, I plotted between different variable  simple charts like **bar chart, grouped bar chart, scatter plot, box plot, heatmap,** and **pairplot.** Based on these graphs, I extracted insights and performed **univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis.** .After data visualization, I discovered amazing and  highly useful insights, which are  few  listed below.
 *  City hotels are more preferred than resort hotels .
 * The most number of customers arrived in August, followed by July and May. The least number of customers arrived in January.
 * Most number of served meal type is BB after SC
 * Most bookings are for short-duration stays, as the majority of customers are transient travelers.
 * Most people do not required car parking space
 * In 2016, 33.3% more bookings were made compared to 2015. After 2017, this dropped to 12.2%
 * The highest number of bookings were made in 2016, followed by 2017 and 2015.
 * Bookings are higher on weekdays compared to weekends, with more reservations made on weekdays.
 * City hotels are more prone to cancellations than resort hotel
 * Longer stays are associated with lower ADR
 * The most frequently booked number of nights is 3, followed by 2, 1, and 4. Very few people book stays longer than 7 nights.
 * People from Portugal (PRT) made the most bookings, followed by Great Britain (GBR) and France (FRA) and  also the highest revenue (ADR) was also generated by Portugal (PRT), followed by Great Britain (GBR) and France (FRA).

  These are some important insights which i mentioned  there are also many other insights I discovered in this project.
* Overall this project provided valuable insights into hotel booking patterns. However, we faced challenges like handling duplicate and missing data and selecting effective visualizations. Despite this, our findings can help improve booking efficiency and customer satisfaction.
